# CSE-150 -> Enhanced Snake Game

## Project Overview

This repository contains the source code and documentation for the "Enhanced Snake Game" project developed as part of the Project Work 1 course (CSE 150). The game is implemented in C++ and designed to run as a console application on a computer.

## Game Description

The "Enhanced Snake Game" is an evolved version of the classic snake game, featuring improved gameplay mechanics, additional features, and bug fixes. Players control a snake on a grid, maneuvering it to consume randomly appearing food items. As the snake consumes food, it grows longer, presenting a challenge to the player. The main goal is to achieve the highest score possible by collecting food without colliding with the snake's own body.

## Controls

- Arrow keys: Up, Down, Left, Right - for controlling the snake's direction.

## Obstacles and New Features

The primary obstacle in the game is the snake's own body. Colliding with the snake's body leads to the end of the game. New features and modifications include:

- **Special Fruits:** Occasionally, special fruits will appear that provide additional points when consumed.
- **Dynamic Difficulty:** The game dynamically adjusts difficulty parameters based on the player's performance.
- **Bug Fixes:** Various bug fixes and optimizations have been implemented for a smoother gaming experience.

## Development Goals

The key development goals included implementing essential game features such as user input handling, random food generation, snake movement mechanics, collision detection, and a scoring system. The enhanced version emphasizes improved gameplay and a more engaging user experience.

## Learning Outcomes

1. **Enhanced Programming Concepts:** Applied advanced programming concepts to improve game mechanics and features.

2. **Advanced Problem-Solving:** Developed advanced problem-solving skills through addressing challenges in game development.

3. **User Input Handling and Game Dynamics:** Implemented more sophisticated user input handling and dynamic game difficulty adjustments.

4. **Algorithmic Optimization:** Optimized algorithms for collision detection and scoring, enhancing overall game performance.

5. **Teamwork and Collaboration:** Continued to enhance teamwork and collaboration skills through group project work as part of Team TwoPointers.
