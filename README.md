        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>This repository contains the source code and documentation for the "Simple Snake Game" project developed as part of the Project Work 1 course (CSE 150). The game is implemented in C++ and designed to run as a console application on a computer.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Game Description</h2>
        <p>The "Simple Snake Game" is a classic snake game where players control a snake on a grid, maneuvering it to consume randomly appearing food items. As the snake consumes food, it grows longer, presenting a challenge to the player. The main goal is to achieve the highest score possible by collecting food without colliding with the snake's own body.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Controls</h2>
        <p>Arrow keys: Up, Down, Left, Right - for controlling the snake's direction.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Obstacle</h2>
        <p>The primary obstacle in the game is the snake's own body. Colliding with the snake's body leads to the end of the game.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Development Goals</h2>
        <p>The key development goals include implementing essential game features such as user input handling, random food generation, snake movement mechanics, collision detection, and a scoring system. The project emphasizes the use of fundamental programming concepts and relevant data structures.</p>
